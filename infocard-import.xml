A slight increase in mass adds marginally to the ship's turning circle, but in exchange, the extra space is used to upgrade the powerplant and engine, increasing energy capacity, regeneration, and the ship's top speed. The Ballistic hardpoint of the original Falcon is downsized to make room for one of the Medium Energy slots to be upgraded into a Large, letting the Fighting Falcon wield a PPC or L Laser without sacrificing the damage potential of a full suite of primary blasters. An upgraded layer of armour boosts the hull's protection without sacrificing much in the way of weight, the homemade result of talented metallurgy and smithing that that has melted down Liberty Navy ship panels and reformed them into a reclaimed second skin. A couple salvaged panels have been bolted onto the sides with their original Navy insignias left intact, reminding would-be opponents exactly who the parts of this refurbished ship were claimed from.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

After months of effort, the Rheinland Navy had taken a series of key locations in Hudson, securing important logistics routes and giving them a solid platform from which to launch a large-scale invasion of Liberty space proper. Alarmed by consistent Rheinland victories against them in the Independent Worlds, the Liberty Navy deployed the bulk of its fleet in Texas, hoping to prevent the RNC from making further progress into Liberty systems. Undeterred, Rheinland capital ships arrived in the system two weeks later.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Shortly after their arrival, the RNC swept across Texas, securing the southern half of the system and pushing into the orbit of Houston. The Liberty Navy responded in kind, deploying five dreadnoughts, many cruisers and countless fighters to meet the invading force. After several hours of intense fighting, it appeared the Rheinland Navy were close to victory, having eliminated the bulk of Liberty’s cruiser complement and severely damaging three of the five defending battleships.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The exact cause of what occurred next isn’t entirely clear. Official Liberty sources claim that Rheinland deployed an untested experimental weapon, but given their tactical and strategic situation at the time it seems unlikely that they had any reason to do so. Anyone caught spreading rumors that conflict with this narrative are investigated and charged with sedition by the LSF.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The resulting blast sent out massive gravitational waves overloading the Texas jumpgates, propagating through them in a cascade and burning out the gate network. Most jump holes were also destabilized by this massive cataclysm. As for Houston, the incredible fluctuations in gravity have torn the crust off the planet in massive chunks, ejecting unprecedented amounts of rock and cooling lava into orbit and scarring the surface permanently. Both orbiting fleets were obliterated almost instantly, putting a swift end to the conflict.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The surface of Houston is now a molten hellscape. The atmosphere has been stripped away and the planet itself gives off a nightmarish red glow as it cools. While the Liberty government has begun investigating the possibility of mining the exposed core of the planet, any prospects of recovery or terraforming the planet back to what it once was are impossible.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Where there’s junk, there are the Junkers. They’ve been around since the earliest days of the Trade Lanes. Descended from the working classes, they developed within the House systems as a sort of necessary evil, handling the dirty work that no one else would. They do well salvaging valuable materials from the ever-increasing debris fields throughout Sirius, with the notable exception of Kusari. To this day they remain held at bay by the Hogosha.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Anyone who deals with Junkers knows they live by a strict code; if you’re not a Junker, you’re not part of the family. A Junker will double-cross you without a second thought, and they’re fiercely protective of each other. Most House corporations consider the Junkers to be simple criminals, but Junkers will occasionally do favors for the police, turning in the odd, mid-level criminal or letting them know about the occasional drug shipment. So despite some harassment, the police stop short of shutting them down. The infrequent police cleanup operations are little more than exercises in public relations, though there’s no love lost between the two groups.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Junkers make their official money from salvaging debris within the fields, but also have a good deal going with various criminals, who like their “no questions asked” policy. Tolerated by the governments, Junkers sometimes deal in contraband, but they are extremely hard to catch red-handed. They are frequently patronized by the criminal element for the refuge they offer within the often hostile territory of House capital systems.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Liberty has two groups: a major population in the New York System, and a smaller enclave in Texas. In the wake of the Houston Catastrophe, the Junkers have shifted Beaumont Base into the shadow of Chisos, moving their operations a significant distance away from the unwelcome Navy presence at the New York Gate. The base’s original location in the North Dallas Debris Field did little to shield it from the worst of the blast, but the Junkers have been quick to repair damage and expand the station nonetheless.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
